Ques : Which would you say is heavier, a pound of cotton or a pund of gold?

Solu: Pound is a unit of weight.
There are two differenr pound units: the avoirdupois pound and the troy pound. The avoidupois pound which is used in everyday situations is equla to 16 ounces. 
The troy pound which is used for precious metals such as gold and silver is equal to 12 ounces.
So, technically , 1 pound of cotton(avoirdupois) would weigh more than 1 pound of gold(troy) because they are using different measurement systems.
