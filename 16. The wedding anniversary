Ques: Receently I attended the twelfth wedding anniversary celebrations of my good friends Mohini and jayant. Beaming with pride,
jayant looked at his wife and commented , "At the time when we got married Mohini was 3/4 of my age but now she is only 5/6 of the my age".
We began to wonder how old the couple must have been at the time of my marriage!
can u figure it out?


Solu: Let mohini age be y and jayant age be x.
Acc to question 
y=3/4(x) at the time of marriage ----->(1)
y+12 =5/6(x+12) after 12 years of marriage  ------>(2)


equating and solving both the equations , we got 
x=24 and y=18 during the time of their marriage.
