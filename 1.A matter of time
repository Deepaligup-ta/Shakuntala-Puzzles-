Ques : Fifty minutes ago , it was four times as many minutes past three'o clock. How many minutes is it to 6'o clock?


Ans :

Let x be the number of minutes to 6 o'clock.

We know that there are 180 minutes between 3 o'clock and 6 o'clock.

Fifty minutes ago, it was 180-x minutes past 3 o'clock.  The problem states that at that time, it was also four times as many minutes past three o'clock as it is until 6 o'clock, which is simply x.

Therefore, we can write the following equation:

180-x = 4x

Solving for x, we get:

5x = 180

x = 36

So the answer is 26.  This means that it is currently 26 minutes to 6 o'clock.
However, there seems to be a slight mistake. The answer we got (36 minutes) contradicts the information given. 50 minutes cannot have passed if it was only 36 minutes to 6:00 PM 50 minutes ago.

Looking closer, the actual number of minutes past 3:00 PM 50 minutes ago should be LESS than the remaining time to 6:00 PM (since it's moving towards 6 o'clock). Therefore, the answer should be:

x = 26 minutes
