Walking all the Way
One day I decided to walk all the way from Banga- lore to Tumkur. I started exactly at noon. And someone I know in Tumkur decided to walk all the way to Bangalore from Tumkur and she started exactly at 2 P.M.,
on the same day.
We met on the Bangalore-Tumkur Road at five past four, and we both reached our destination at exactly the same time.
At what time did we both arrive?
