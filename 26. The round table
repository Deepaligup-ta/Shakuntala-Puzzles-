Ques : We have a circular dining table made of marble which had come down to us as a fmaily heriloom. We also have some beautiful bine-china saurers that i recently from japan.
Diameter of our table top is fifteen times the diameter of our saurcers which are also circular. We would like to place the saurcers on table so that the neither overlap each others nor 
edge of table. How many can we olace in this manner?
