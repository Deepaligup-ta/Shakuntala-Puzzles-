Ques : Some time back while in England I came across a case in a criminal court. A man was being accused of havings tolen certain valuable jewels and trying to run away with them. When he was caught by a smart police officer who overtook him.
In cross examination the lawyer for accused asked the police officer how he could catch up with the accused who was laready twenty seven steps ahead of him, when he started to run after him.
Yes sir, the officer replied. He takes eight steps to every five of mine.
But then officer interrogated the lawyer, how did you even catch him, if that was the case?

Thats easily explained sir, replied the officer. I have got a longer strude, two steps of mine are eual to his five. So the number of steps i required were fever than his and this broght me to the spot where i captured him.
A member of the jury, who was particularly good at quick calculations did some checking and figured out the number of steps he police officer must have taken.
Can u also find out how many steps the officer needed to catch up with the theif?

Solu:The police officer took thirty steps. In the same time the theif took 48 steps , which added to his start of the twenty seven, that means he took seventy five steps. This distance would be exactly equal to 30 steps of the pilice officer.
