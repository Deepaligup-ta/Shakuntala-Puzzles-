Ques: My friend shuba works in a post office and she sells stamps. One day a man walked in and kepy seventy five paise on the counter and requested,
'please give me some 2 paise stamps and six times as many as one paisa stamps and for the rest of the amount give me 5 paise stamps.
The bewildered shuba thpught for a few moments and finally she handed over the exact fulfilment of the order to the man-with a smile.
How would you have handled the situation.
