Ques: My friend Asha was throwing a very grand part and wanted to borrow from me 100 wine glasses. I decided to send them through my boy servant, harish. 
Just to give an incentive to harish to deliver the glasses intact I offered him 3 paise for every glass delivered safely and threatened to forefeit 9 paise for every glass he broke. 
On settlement harish received Rs. 240 from me . How many glasses did Harish break?


Solu :
Let the number of glasses broke be G.
therefor 3G= amount earned.
ATQ,
9B= amount forfeit.
3(100-G)-9G=240 ------>(1)
solving it 
300-3G-9G=240,
60=12G,
G=5;
