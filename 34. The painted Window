Ques: My room has a square window of 4 fee across and 4 feet down. I decided to get only half the area of the window painted.
Even after the painting I found that the clear part of the window still remained a square and still measured 4 feet top to bottom 
and 4 feet from side to side. How is it possible?

Solu: 
Leaving rhombus in between of the window and painting the outer area can fulfill this thing.
