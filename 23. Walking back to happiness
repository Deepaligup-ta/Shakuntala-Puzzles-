Ques : A man I know, who lives in my neightbourhood, travels to chinsura everyday for his work. His wife drives him over to howrahs station every morning and in the evening exactly at 6 pm.
She picks him up from the sttaion and takes him home.One day he was let off at work an hour earlier, and so he arrived at the howrah station at 5 pm, instead of 6 pm. He started walking home. 
However, he met his wife enroute to the station and got into the car. They drove hoe arrivig 10 minutes earlier than usual.
How long did the man have to walk, before he was picked up by his wife?
