Ques: Two women were selling marbles in the market p;lace-one at three for a paisa and other at two for a paisa. One day both of them were obliged to return home when each had thrity marbles unsold.
They put together the two lot of marbles unsold. They put together the two lot of marbles and handling them over to a firned asked her to sell them at five for 2 paisa . According to their calculation after all,
3 for one paisa and 2 for one paisa was exactly same as 5 for 2 paise.According to their calculation, after all , 3 for one paisa and 2 for one paisa was exactly the same as 5 fpr 2 paise. Now they were expecting
to get 25 paise for the marbles, as they would have got if sold seperatley. But much to their surprise they got only 24 paise for the entire lot.
Now where did the one paisa go? Can u explain the mystery?


Solu:
lets assume that two womans A and B has given A has 30 marbles and b has 30 marbles , if they are given to a friend to sell 5 marbles for 2 paise 
then, 60=12*5, 12*2=24 paise they got, but if they sell seperately , 
A would have made , A sells 3 marbles for 1 paise therefore 10 rupees, while 
B would have made, B sells 2 marbles for 1 paise therefor 15 rupees.
combinly they will get 10+15=25 paise. 

So this way they got 24 paise assuming for 25 paise.
