Ques : A railway track runs parallel to a road until a bend brings the road to a level crossing. A cyclist rides along to work along the road every day at a constant speed of 12 miles per hour.
He normally meets a train that travels in the same direction at the crossing. One day he was late by 25 minutes and met the train 6 miles ahead of the level crossing. Can you figure out the speed of the train?
