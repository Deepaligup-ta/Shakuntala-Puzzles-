Ques : While walking down the street, one morning, I found a hundred rupee note on the foot path. I picked it up, noted the number and took it home. 
In the afternoon the plumber called on me to collect his bill. As I had no other money at home, I settled his account with the hundred rupee note I had found. Later I came to know that the plumber paid the note to his milkman to settle his money account, who paid it to his tailor for the garments he had made. 
The tailor in turn used the money to busy an old sewing machine from a woman who lives in my neihbourhood. This woman incidentally had borrowed hundred rupees from me sometime back to buy a pressure cokker, rembering that she owed me hundred rupees, came and paid the debt. 
I recognized the note as the one I had found on the footpath and on careful examination I discovered that the billl was counterfeit.
How much was lost in the whole transaction and and by whom?


Solu: If we begin from the beginning , that boy paid it to the plumber - 100 rupees loss for plumber
after that plumber paid it to milkman , milkan lost 100 rupees and then paid it to the tailor for garments, 100 rupees loss to the tailor 
tailor paid it to the woman for sewing machine , 100 rupees loss to her also. 
As, that woman was in debt and that boy was the owner, therefore no losses to him , 
Milkamn, plumber , tailor lost rupees 100 , 300 was loss in the total.
