Ques: A friend of mine in Bangalore owns a horse-driven carriage. It was found that the fore wheels of the carriage make four more revolutions than the hind wheel in going 96 feet. 
Howver, it was found that if the circuference f the fore wheel was 3/2 as great and of the hind wheel 4/3 as great, then the fore wheel would make only 2 revolutions more than hind wheel 
in going the same distance of 96 feet.
Can you find the circumference of each wheel?
