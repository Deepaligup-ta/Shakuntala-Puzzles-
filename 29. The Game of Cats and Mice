Ques: Anumber of cats got together and decided to kill between them 999919 mice. Every cat killed an equal number of mice. How many cats do you think there were? 
Oh, by the way let me clarify just two points, it is not one cat killed the lot, becuase I have said 'Cats'
and it is not 999919 cats each killed one mouse because I have used the word'mice'.
I can give you just one clue-each cat killed more mice that there were cats.


Solu:
Let the number of cats be X.
Let the number of mouse be Y.
X*Y=999919
we have only tw prime numbers in this, 991,1009 which when multiplied will give total number.
therefore 991 cats killed 1009 mouse.
