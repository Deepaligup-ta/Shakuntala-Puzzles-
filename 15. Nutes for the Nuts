Ques : Last time i visited a friends farm near Bangalore he gave me a bag containing 1000 peanuts.From this I took out 230 peanuts for myself and gave away teh bag with the remainder of peanuts to three little brothers who live in my neighbourhood
and told them to distribute the nuts among, themselves in proportion to their ages-which together amounted to 17.5 years.
Tinku, Rinku and jojo the three brothers, divided the nuts in following manner:
as often as Tinku took four Rinku took three and as often as tinku took six and jojo took seven.
with this data can u find out what were the respective ages of the boys and how many nutes each got?
