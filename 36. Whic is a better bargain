Ques : Recently while shopping in New market in calcutta. I came across two very nice frocks selling at a discount. I decided to buy one of them for my little girl Mammu.
The shopkeeper offered me one of frocks for Rs. 35 usually selling for 8/7 of that price and other one for Rs30 usually selling for 7/6 of that price . Of the two frocks which one do you think is better bargain 
and by how much percent?

Solu: 8/7 th of RS. 35= 40; 
7/6 of 30= 35
If first frock usually sells for rs 40 and now it is sold for rs 35 then saving = rs 5; This gives me a gain on percentage 5/35= 14. 28
same for secodn frock 5/ 30= 16.66 therefore difference is 2.38. Hence the secodn frock is a better buy.
