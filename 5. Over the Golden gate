Ques :  While in San Fransisco some time back, I hired a car to drive over a golden gate bridge. I started in the afternoon when there was no traffic rush. So I could drive at a speed of 40 miles an hour. While returning. However, I got caught in the traffic rush and I could only manage to drive at a speed of 25 miles an hour. What was my average speed for a round trip. 

Solu : No, the answer is not 32.5 an hour, though this fugure is obvious ans. However, this represents the average of 2 speeds not of the whole round trip. If the time is equal to the distance divided by the average speed , then the time for the trip starting from san fransisco equlas S/40 amd time to return will be S/25, which gives us total of S/40 +S/25 which is equal to 13S/200. 
Therefore the average spped for the whole trip when the average speed equals the distance divided by the time is 2S divided by 13S/200 , which is 400S/13 or 30 10/13 miles per hour.
