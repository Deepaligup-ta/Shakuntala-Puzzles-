Ques : A fiend of mine runs a bicycle shop and he narrated to me this following story:
A man who looked like a tourist, came to his shop one day and bought a bicycle from him for Rs. 350. 
The cost price of the bicycle was Rs.300. So my friend was happy that he had made a profit of Rs.50 on the sale. 
However,at the time of settling the bill, the tourist offered to pay in travllers cheques as hed had no cash money with him. My friend hesitated. He had no arrangement wuth the banks to encash travellers cheques. 
But he remebered that the shopkeeper next door has such a provision, and so he took the cheques to his friend next dorr and got cash from him. 
The travellers cheques were all of Rs. 100 each and so he ahd taken four cheques from the tourist totalling to RS. 400. On encashing them my friend paid back the tourist RS.50. 
The tourist happily climbed the bicycle and pedalled away whistling a tune. However, the enxt morning my frinds neighbour, who had taken the travellers cheques to the band, called on him and returned the cheques which had proved value less and demanded the refund of his money. 
My friend quitely refunded the money to his neighbour and tried to trace the tourist who had given him the worthless cheques and taken away his bicycle. 
But the tourist could not be found.
How much did my friend ose together in this unfortunate transaction?


Solution : 
Here's the breakdown of the loss:

Cost price of the bicycle: Rs. 300
Selling price of the bicycle: Rs. 350
Profit made on the sale: Rs. 50
Total value of the traveller's cheques (worthless): Rs. 400
Money returned to the neighbor who cashed the cheques: Rs. 400


Therefore, shopkeeper lost Rs. 750 in total , 300 for bicycle , 50 paid to customer, and 400 to the next door shopkeeper.
