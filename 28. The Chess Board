Ques: We all know that chess board has 64 squares. This can be completely covered by 32 rectangles each covering 2 sqaures.
Supposing we remove 2 squares of chess board at diagonally opposite corners, can we cover the modified board with 31 rectangles?
Can we dot it, if yes how and if no explain.

Solu:
No it cant be done. As on chess board we have 64 squares, two adjacent squares are of different colours. If we remove two squares diagonally, they will be of same colours,
So, remaining will have two more boxes of same colour. and after covering 60 boxes, two boxes will be left , therefore not possible to cover.
